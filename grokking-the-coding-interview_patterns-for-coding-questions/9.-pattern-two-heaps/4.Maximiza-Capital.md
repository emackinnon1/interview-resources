# 502. IPO
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)

## Problem

Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return *the final maximized capital*.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 105`
- `0 <= w <= 109`
- `n == profits.length`
- `n == capital.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= profits[i] <= 104`
- `0 <= capital[i] <= 109`

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use two priority queues (heaps):

1. A **min heap** (`minCapitalHeap`) to keep track of projects sorted by their minimum capital requirements.
2. A **max heap** (`maxProfitHeap`) to store projects sorted by their profits in descending order.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Initialize `currentCapital`with the initial capital **`w`**.
2. Add all projects to `minCapitalHeap`.
3. For each of the **`k`** iterations:
    - While `minCapitalHeap`is not empty and the project’s minimum capital requirement is less than or equal to `currentCapital`, move the project from `minCapitalHeap` to `maxProfitHeap`.
    - If `maxProfitHeap`is empty, break the loop.
    - Otherwise, select the project with the highest profit from `maxProfitHeap`, add its profit to `currentCapital`, and remove it from `maxProfitHeap`.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        // Min heap to track projects by their minimum capital requirements
				PriorityQueue<Integer> minCapitalHeap= new PriorityQueue<>((i, j) -> capital[i] - capital[j]);
        
				// Max heap to store projects sorted by their profits in descending order
				PriorityQueue<Integer> maxProfitHeap= new PriorityQueue<>((i, j) -> profits[j] - profits[i]);

				// Initialize current capital with the initial amount
        int currentCapital= w;

				// Add all projects to the minCapitalHeap
        for (int i = 0; i < capital.length; i++)
            minCapitalHeap.offer(i);

				// Select at most k distinct projects
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
						// Move projects from minCapitalHeap to maxProfitHeap if their capital requirement is met
            while (!minCapHeap.isEmpty() && capital[minCapitalHeap.peek()] <= currentCapital)
                maxProfitHeap.offer(minCapitalHeap.poll());

						// If no profitable projects left, exit the loop
            if (maxProHeap.isEmpty()) break;

						// Select the project with the highest profit, update current capital
            currentCapital+= profits[maxProfitHeap.poll()];
        }

        return currentCapital;
    }
}
```

## Complexities

- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to the heap operations.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the heaps.
