# Pattern : Two Heaps
**Two Heaps Pattern: Notes**

The **Two Heaps Pattern** is a powerful technique used in solving certain algorithmic problems. It involves using two heaps (data structures) to efficiently manage and process data. Here are the key points about this pattern:

1. **What is the Two Heaps Pattern?**
   - The Two Heaps Pattern uses two heaps simultaneously to solve specific problems.
   - It typically involves a **Min Heap** and a **Max Heap**.
   - The Min Heap helps find the smallest element, while the Max Heap helps find the largest element.

2. **Common Problems Solved Using Two Heaps:**
   - **Median of a Stream**: Maintaining a running median of a stream of numbers.
   - **Sliding Window Problems**: Efficiently handling sliding windows in arrays or strings.
   - **Top K Elements**: Finding the top K elements in a dataset.
   - Other problems where you need to track both minimum and maximum values.

3. **How to Use Two Heaps:**
   - Initialize a Min Heap and a Max Heap.
   - Split the input into two parts: one for maximum elements and the other for minimum elements.
   - For example, if we have the numbers 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15, we split them into:
     - Max heap: 2, 6, 8
     - Min heap: 10, 12, 15
   - The median can be calculated based on these heaps (average for even numbers, middle element for odd numbers).

4. **When to Use Two Heaps:**
   - When you can divide the input into two parts, with one part containing maximum elements and the other containing minimum elements.
   - Also applicable when two properties are directly proportional, and you want to minimize one while maximizing the other (e.g., capital and profit).
